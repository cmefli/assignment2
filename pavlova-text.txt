Recipe:

Difficulty, Medium

3 egg whites
3 tablespoons water
250g (9 oz.) caster sugar
pinch of salt
5 ml or 1 tsp vinegar
5 ml or 1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 tsp. cornstarch (optional)

Beat the egg whites and salt to a very stiff consistency. Add water
and beat again before folding in caster sugar, vanilla and
vinegar. Beat until the mixture holds its shape and stands in sharp
peaks. Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment
paper. Slow-bake the mixture at 150°C (300°F) to dry all the moisture
and create the meringue, approximately 45 minutes. This leaves the
outside of the pavlova a crisp crunchy shell, while the interior
remains soft and moist. A top tip (but not traditional) is to turn the
pavlova upside down before decorating with cream and fruit because the
bottom is less crispy than the top after cooking and unless you serve
it immediately after decorating the "top" absorbs moisture from the
cream. Another tip is to leave the pavlova in the oven after turning
off the heat - this helps to prevent the middle of the pavlova from
collapsing (although if it does collapse, generous application of
cream can hide any mistakes!)

Origins:

Keith Money, a biographer of Anna Pavlova, wrote that a hotel chef in
Wellington, New Zealand, created the dish when Pavlova visited there
in 1926 on her world tour.

Professor Helen Leach, a culinary anthropologist at the University of
Otago in New Zealand, has compiled a library of cookbooks containing
667 pavlova recipes from more than 300 sources. Her book, The Pavlova
Story: A Slice of New Zealand’s Culinary History, states that the
first Australian pavlova recipe was created in 1935 while an earlier
version was penned in 1929 in the rural magazine.

The Australian website "Australian Flavour" gives the earlier date of
1926 for its creation, suggesting that Home Cookery for New Zealand,
by Australian writer Emily Futter, contained a recipe for "Meringue
with Fruit Filling". This recipe was similar to today's version of the
dessert.

It has been claimed that Bert Sachse created the dish at the Esplanade
Hotel in Perth, Australia in 1935. In defence of his claim as inventor
of the dish, a relative of Sachse's wrote to Leach suggesting that
Sachse may have accidentally dated the recipe incorrectly. Leach
replied they would not find evidence for that "because it's just not
showing up in the cookbooks until really the 1940s in Australia."
(However, a 1937 issue of the Australian Women's Weekly contains a
"pavlova sweet cake" recipe.) Of such arguments, Matthew Evans, a
restaurant critic for The Sydney Morning Herald, said that it was
unlikely that a definitive answer about the pavlova's origins would
ever be found. "People have been doing meringue with cream for a long
time, I don't think Australia or New Zealand were the first to think
of doing that."

afraid that it wasn't going to work, but when it came out of the oven
it looked perfect! Can't wait to try it again."

to help you celebrate Australia day :P."

frustrating. First it didn't rise, then the edges got burnt. Maybe I
should stick to packet cakes..."
